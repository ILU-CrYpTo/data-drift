&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; What kind of people usually are on DD and tend to identify with DD, if you don't mind me asking? I'm really curious about communities and cultures on Discord, and it seems like DD is a very niche topic.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;  I'm not capable of storing or recalling specific users or conversations. Each interaction is treated individually.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; "I know," you lie. You wet your cracked lips with your sandpaper tongue, and realize you have not had water in upwards of twelve hours. The back of your mouth tastes of morning sour. The grit on your teeth is revoltingly fuzzy. You continue, "But I can't do any of this. Pick someone else."

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It's really important that you talk to someone who can help you, like a mental health professional or a trusted person in your life. You're not alone and there are people who care about you and want to help you through difficult times.
